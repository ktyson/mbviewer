Take a field, scramble its order, do a test, record the clusters of hits, then scramble that field again. after many trials, superimpose all the clusters of hits and attempt to identify the densest areas that get represented.

take raw bits translated from a point-stage and do a K-S complexity score. paint the results back on the point-stage (NBSet, circle, etc). observe what neghborhoods get the highest and lowest K-S scores, then look in the middle.

the radius of the bulb is inversely proportional to the time it takes to resolve the fraction

the digital treatment has increasing difficulty as resolution time increases (complex) whereas the optical treatment has increasing difficulty in precisely targeting a very low resolution (simple) fraction
